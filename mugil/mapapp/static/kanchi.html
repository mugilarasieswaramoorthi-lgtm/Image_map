         Kanchipuram, often called the “City of Thousand Temples,” is one of the most ancient and sacred cities in Tamil Nadu.
         Renowned for its stunning Dravidian architecture, it is home to magnificent temples like Ekambareswarar, Kailasanathar,
         and Varadharaja Perumal, which reflect centuries of art, devotion, and dynastic heritage. The city is equally famous
         for its exquisite Kanchipuram silk sarees, handwoven with vibrant colors and rich zari work, making it a hub of traditional craftsmanship.
         As one of the seven Moksha-puris in India, Kanchipuram holds immense spiritual significance for devotees and travelers alike. Blending culture, 
         religion, and artistic legacy, the city stands as a timeless symbol of Tamil heritage and devotion.
