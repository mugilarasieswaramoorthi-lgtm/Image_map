         Ponnai is a peaceful town known for its natural surroundings, rural charm, and cultural roots. 
         Located near the Andhraâ€“Tamil Nadu border, it is surrounded by small villages, farmlands, 
         and gentle landscapes. The Ponnai River adds to the beauty of the region and supports agriculture 
         and daily life. The town reflects a blend of tradition and simplicity, with local temples, festivals, 
         and community life forming its identity. Though small in size, Ponnai holds a quiet significance for 
         the people in and around Vellore district, offering a calm and connected way of living.
